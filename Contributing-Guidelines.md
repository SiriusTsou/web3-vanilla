# Contributing Guidelines

I welcome any and all questions/suggestions/PRs/etc.! If you're interested in helping out, here's a (brief) guide to get you started:

- The project is written in javascript, all source files are in the [`src/`](./src/) directory.

- To build/watch for changes, run `npm run all`.
